            We are setting the benchmark in building sustainable industrial
            infrastructure and logistics and warehousing solutions. With two
            large-scale ready-to-move industrial parks in Chakan and a third on
            the way, KSH INFRA is moving from strength to strength in developing
            the strategic industrial corridor as a hub for manufacturing and
            logistics.

            ESG compliance, and the team is resolute in its commitmentâ€”a
